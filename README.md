# Run Tracker ðŸ‘Ÿ

## About

This an app to registrer and compare your running progress. This was made as a test of the wails framework in my search for a tauri alternative, and I have to say that I found it.

Below I left the default instructions of the wails project builder, but I suggest refering to their site for better directions.

## Live Development

To run in live development mode, run `wails dev` in the project directory. This will run a Vite development
server that will provide very fast hot reload of your frontend changes. If you want to develop in a browser
and have access to your Go methods, there is also a dev server that runs on <http://localhost:34115>. Connect
to this in your browser, and you can call your Go code from devtools.

## Building

To build a redistributable, production mode package, use `wails build`.
